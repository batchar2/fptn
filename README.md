FPTN operates by securely routing network traffic from your device through a VPN server to bypass censorship and access restricted content.
The process involves encapsulating your traffic within a secure WebSocket tunnel, which is then processed by the VPN server.
Here's a high-level overview of the workflow:

```

```

FPTN can be seamlessly integrated with **NGINX**, allowing you to disguise the VPN server behind any regular web server.
This can be particularly useful in evading detection and bypassing restrictive network filters.
By using NGINX to proxy WebSocket connections, you can effectively hide the VPN server behind the facade of a regular website.

### FPTN Client Installation and Setup

*üçèüçéFor MacOS users, please refer to the [macOS installation guide](docs/macos/README.md) for detailed instructions, as macOS has additional security measures that may require special steps.*

Download the FPTN client from [WebSite](http://batchar2.github.io/fptn/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/batchar2/fptn/releases). After downloading, install and run the client.

The client is a compact application with an interface located in the routing tray.

Simply click on the icon to open the context menu.

  <summary>FPTN Server Installation and Configuration</summary>

##### Step 1: Download FPTN from GitHub
Download the FPTN server DEB package for your architecture (x86_64 or arm64) from [GitHub](https://github.com/batchar2/fptn/releases).

##### Step 2: Install the DEB Package

To install the FPTN server DEB package, consider your processor architecture (ADM or ARM). Run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
sudo apt install -f /path/to/fptn-server.deb
```

##### Step 3: Generate sertificate

Navigate to the /etc/fptn/ directory:
```bash
cd /etc/fptn/
```

Generate the required keys using OpenSSL:

```bash
openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048
openssl req -new -x509 -key server.key -out server.crt -days 365
openssl rsa -in server.key -pubout -out server.pub

```

##### Step 4: Configure the Server

Open the server configuration file /etc/fptn/server.conf and set it up as follows:

```bash
# Configuration for fptn server

OUT_NETWORK_INTERFACE=eth0

# KEYS
SERVER_KEY=server.key
SERVER_CRT=server.crt
SERVER_PUB=server.pub

PORT=443
TUN_INTERFACE_NAME=fptn0

LOG_FILE=/var/log/fptn-server.log
```

Configuration File Fields
- `OUT_NETWORK_INTERFACE` Specifies the network interface that the server will use for outgoing traffic (e.g., eth0 for Ethernet). Ensure this is set to the correct network interface on your routing.
- `SERVER_KEY` The filename of the private key for the server. This key is used for encrypting and signing communications.
- `SERVER_CRT` The filename of the server's SSL certificate. This certificate is used to establish a secure connection between the server and clients.
- `SERVER_PUB` The filename of the public key derived from the private key. This is used by clients to verify the server's identity.
- `PORT` The port number on which the server will listen for incoming connections (e.g., 443). Ensure this port is open and not in use by other services.
- `TUN_INTERFACE_NAME` The name of the virtual network interface used by the VPN (e.g., fptn0). This interface is used for tunneling VPN traffic.
- `LOG_FILE` The path to the log file where server logs will be written (e.g., /var/log/fptn-server.log). This file is useful for troubleshooting and monitoring server activity.

##### Step 5: Add User

Before restarting the server, add a user with bandwidth limits. Use the following command:

```bash
sudo fptn-passwd --add-user user10 --bandwidth 30
```

This command adds a user named user10 and sets a bandwidth limit of 30 MB for this user.

##### Step 7: Start the Server

To start the server, use the following command:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable fptn-server
sudo systemctl start fptn-server

# Disable kernel logs for "fptn0" interface
echo ':msg, contains, "fptn0" stop' | sudo tee -a /etc/rsyslog.d/10-block-tun.conf
sudo systemctl restart rsyslog
```

Check the server status with:
```bash

sudo systemctl status fptn-server
```

##### Step 8: DNS

To configure a `DNS server` using `dnsmasq`, follow these steps:

1. Install dnsmasq

Install the dnsmasq package using the following command:


```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install dnsmasq
sudo systemctl enable dnsmasq
sudo systemctl start dnsmasq
```


2. Additional settings for systemd

If you are using Ubuntu 24.04/22.04, follow these additional steps:

Open the file `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf`

Find the DNSStubListener parameter, uncomment it, and change the value to no:

```bash
DNSStubListener=no
```

Restart the systemd-resolved service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
```

3. Configure dnsmasq

Open the dnsmasq configuration file `/etc/dnsmasq.conf`

Add or modify the following line to set up DNS forwarding to Google's public DNS server:

```bash
server=8.8.8.8          # Google DNS IPv4
server=8.8.4.4          # Google Secondary DNS IPv4
server=2001:4860:4860::8888  # Google DNS IPv6
server=2001:4860:4860::8844  # Google Secondary DNS IPv6
```

4. Restart dnsmasq

Apply the changes by restarting the dnsmasq service:


```
sudo systemctl restart dnsmasq
sudo systemctl enable dnsmasq
```

5. Verify the Configuration

Check the status of dnsmasq to ensure it is running correctly:

```
sudo systemctl status dnsmasq
```

You can also test DNS resolution to confirm that the server is working:

```
dig @127.0.0.1 google.com
```

##### Step 9: Running

To connect the client to your server, create an FPTN configuration file and save it as `MyFptnServer.fptn`

Use the following template:

```
{
    "version": 1,
    "service_name": "MyFptnServer",
    "username": "YOUR_USER",
    "password": "YOUR_PASSWORD",
    "servers": [
        {
            "name": "MyFptnServer",
            "host": "YOUR_IP",
            "md5_fingerprint": "YOUR_SERVER_FINGERPRINT"
            "port": 443
        }
    ]
}
```
* Replace `YOUR_USER` and `YOUR_PASSWORD` with the `username` and `password` you created in `Step 5: Add User`.
* Replace the `YOUR_SERVER_FINGERPRINT` value with your server‚Äôs certificate fingerprint. To get it, run the following command and copy the result:
  
  ```bash
  openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -md5 -in /etc/fptn/server.crt | cut -d'=' -f2 | tr -d ':' | tr 'A-F' 'a-f'
  ```

* Replace the `YOUR_IP` field to the public IP address of your server.

üí° You can use this file on macOS clients to connect.
For other types of clients, you may need to create a `TOKEN` instead.

##### Step 10 Token creation 

To create a token, encode the content from the file in Step 9 using Base64.
Go to [Base64 Encode](https://www.base64encode.org), paste the content into the input field, and generate the encoded string. After encoding, remove any `=` characters at the end of the Base64 string ‚Äî the result will be your token.
and you can use this base 64 like a token

Example

Original Base64 (before removing `=`):

```
AicG9ydCI6IDQ0MwogICAgICAgIH0KICAgIF0KfQ==
```

Final token (after removing `=`):

```
AicG9ydCI6IDQ0MwogICAgICAgIH0KICAgIF0KfQ
```


(Optional) Add `fptn:` prefix
```
fptn:AicG9ydCI6IDQ0MwogICAgICAgIH0KICAgIF0KfQ
```


##### Step 11 (optional). Telegram and Grafana

To create a token, you need to encode the content from step 9 using Base64. To do this, copy the content from step 9 and visit [Telegram bot](sysadmin-tools/telegram-bot/README.md) and [Grafana](sysadmin-tools/grafana/README.md).
With these tools, you can run your own bot and monitoring routing.

##### Step 4. Run in Command Line
Using the user credentials created in the previous step, try to connect via the command line:

```bash
fptn-client-cli --access-token=your-access-token
```

*In some situations, you may need to specify your network gateway IP (e.g., router IP) using the `--gateway-ip` option when the client cannot automatically detect it
or `--out-network-interface` option to set the specific network interface to be used.*

##### Step 5 (Optional): Configure the Client

You can run fptn-client as a systemd service. To do this, open the client configuration file at `/etc/fptn-client/client.conf` and set it up as follows:

```bash
# Configuration for FPTN client (required)
ACCESS_TOKEN=

# Optional: Specify the network interface
NETWORK_INTERFACE=

# Optional: Specify the gateway IP (e.g., router IP)
GATEWAY_IP=
```

Configuration File Fields:
- `ACCESS_TOKEN` Access token.
- `NETWORK_INTERFACE` (Optional) The network interface on the client device to be used for VPN connections (e.g., eth0 or wlan0).
- `GATEWAY_IP` (Optional) The IP address of the gateway for the VPN connection (your router's address)

##### Step 6 (Optional): Start the Client Service

To start the FPTN client service, use the following command:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable fptn-client
sudo systemctl start fptn-client
```

Check the client service status with:
